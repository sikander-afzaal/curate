            Curateâ€™s mission is to be the one-stop platform for long-term health
            mapping. It empowers individuals to obtain multiple biological
            measurements, identify and measure symptoms and determine how these
            change over time by utilising personalised recommendations. Curate
            utilises test data, big data assets such as community data, and
            smart wearable data to formulate its personalised recommendations.
